# Week 3 – Intelligent Log Insights

This week builds on Week 2 by adding:
- Categorization of modules and error levels.
- Summary insights with counts.
- Structured HTML output for easier analysis.


The parser would extract:

Timestamps
Error levels (ERROR, WARN, etc.)
IP addresses
System module names (nginx, apache, etc.)
And provide statistics about their occurrence in the logs.
This code would be useful for:

Log analysis
System monitoring
Troubleshooting
Security auditing
Performance monitoring
